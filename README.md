Card Shuffle, Dealing Challenge

This is done with java 8 (openjdk), maven and junit 5

source code under src/main, test code under src/test

To run unit tests, run "mvn test" under root folder (Assuming the Java env is already up, you may also need to install maven, on my ubuntu, I installed it by "sudo apt-get install maven")
